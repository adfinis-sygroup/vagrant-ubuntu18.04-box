BUILD IMAGES

Build some basic plain images.

USAGE
=====
To use the builded images, you need to add those with vagrant.

.. code-block:: Bash

  for f in *.box; do
      BOX="$(basename "$f" .box)"
      vagrant box add --name "$(echo "$BOX" | cut -d- -f2-)" "${BOX}.box"

After you add the boxes, you can start a box with vagrant like this

.. code-block:: Bash

  vagrant init adsy-debian-8
  vagrant up adsy-debian-8
  vagrant ssh
